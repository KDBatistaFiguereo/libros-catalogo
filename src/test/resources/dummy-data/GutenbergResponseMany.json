        "\"The Apple-Tree\" by L. H. Bailey is a horticultural text written in the early 20th century. The book explores the apple-tree in great detail, discussing its characteristics, growth, and significance in landscapes as well as in human culture. It reflects on the personal and emotional connections one can have with apple-trees, intertwining observations of nature with insights into gardening and agriculture.  The opening portion introduces the reader to the contrasting landscapes of tropical regions and the familiar home environment associated with apple-trees. The author expresses a sense of longing for his memories of home, dominated by lush orchards and the comforting presence of apple-trees. Bailey paints vivid images of the lushness and variety found in tropical vegetation, yet reveals an underlying dissatisfaction due to the absence of familiar flora. This comparison sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the apple-tree, its biological intricacies, and its importance as a symbol of agricultural life and personal nostalgia.

        "\"Manual of Gardening\" by L. H. Bailey is a practical guide to gardening and landscaping, published in the early 20th century. The book aims to assist home gardeners in creating aesthetically pleasing gardens while cultivating flowers, fruits, and vegetables. It emphasizes the significance of personal connection to gardening, suggesting that every family can have their garden, regardless of the space they possess.  The opening of the book establishes a strong philosophy around gardening, defining a garden as a personal and expressive element of one's home. Bailey stresses that the essence of gardening lies not merely in the selection of plants but in the emotional satisfaction they bring. He argues for a mindset that embraces the joy of growing plants, even if they are not the exact choices intended. The author shares insights on the intrinsic beauty of plants that naturally flourish in their environments and encourages a loving acceptance of the flora that thrives, regardless of whether they were deliberately planted. This sets the tone for the book, which blends practical advice on garden design and plant care with a deeper appreciation for the joy and satisfaction that gardening can yield.

        "\"Euthydemus\" by Plato is a dialogue written around 384 BC. In this satirical work, Socrates recounts to his friend Crito a meeting with two Sophist brothers who claim philosophical superiority. Through a series of increasingly absurd logical tricks and fallacies, the brothers attempt to trap Socrates in verbal puzzles designed to be impossible to refute. Plato contrasts genuine Socratic education with what he presents as the deceptive methods of Sophist argumentation, exposing the emptiness behind their intellectual showmanship.
